In the realm of navigation applications utilizing Google Maps, there exists a need to design and implement bespoke shortest path finder algorithms, steering clear of Google's proprietary closed-source methods. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

#### Algorithmic Diversity:
Develop a solution that incorporates a minimum of three distinct shortest path finder algorithms.
Facilitate a comprehensive real-time performance analysis to discern the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

#### Independence from Native Google Algorithms:
Devise algorithms that operate independently of Google's native closed-source routing mechanisms.
Ensure a high degree of customization and adaptability to diverse real-world scenarios.

#### Graphical Visualization:
Implement a visually intuitive graphical user interface to depict the dynamic functioning of the algorithms on Google Maps.
Enhance understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms through real-time graphical representations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Java
- JavaFX
- Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thejediboySHASHANK/Message_Queue_Backend.git

### Usage/Configuration

Contact this repository's owner, if you want to run it yourself locally in your machine.


### Explanation

I have made a prototype of Gmaps navigation algorithm to emulate the navigation that happens in Gmaps and other related map navigation softwares. As, Google Maps is closed source, I have implemented BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s and A* Algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two points, i.e Start and Destination Point. 

Google Maps API is used only for Map demonstration purposes through extracting the intersection points from the Maps to calculate the shortest path.
